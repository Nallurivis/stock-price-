**Hybrid Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series Analysis and Machine Learning with News Sentiment Integration**:

**Introduction**:

Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the volatile and complex nature of financial markets. Traditional models like ARIMA are effective for capturing trends, while machine learning models like LSTMs can identify non-linear patterns. Additionally, external factors, such as news and social media sentiment, often influence market movements, creating sudden spikes or drops.

This project aims to develop a hybrid model that combines these three approaches—time series analysis, machine learning, and sentiment analysis—to improve the accuracy of stock price predictions. By integrating historical stock data, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis, this model seeks to offer a more robust and comprehensive predictive solution.

**Methodology**:

The methodology involves several key steps:

**Data Collection:**
Historical stock prices will be gathered from sources like Yahoo Finance and Alpha Vantage. Sentiment data will be collected from financial news and social media using APIs such as GDELT, MediaStack, and Twitter Developer Platform.
**Data Preprocessing:** The collected data will be cleaned, missing values will be handled, and sentiment scores will be aggregated.
**Feature Engineering: **Technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI) and sentiment-based features will be created to enhance the dataset.
**Model Development:** Both traditional (ARIMA) and machine learning models (LSTM, Random Forest) will be developed and tuned.
**Hybrid Integration & Evaluation:** The predictions from these models will be integrated, and the performance will be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
**Reporting:** Findings will be compiled, visualizations will be created, and a comprehensive report will be prepared.
